Rocket_AI is a reinforcement learning algorithm that tries to stabilize the position of a rocket in a simplified space environment.

The concept is simple, a rocket is situated in the middle of nowhere and has only one goal, stabilize its position with the help of its three engines.

To make this model, we use Reinforcement Learning and the Q-Learning algorithm. Because we want the most optimized model, we will do Hyperparameter Optimization.
